the sun is shining
the weather is nice today
the wall is blue
I have a dog
the car is green
I am cold
she runs fast
he is tall
she has brown hair
they have blue eyes
the grass is wet
it is raining outside
the man is sad
the boys are laughing
she saw a brown dog
I like ice cream
the baby is crying
he is reading the newspaper
humans cannot fly
she walks on the road
I am going to the shop
she opened the door
